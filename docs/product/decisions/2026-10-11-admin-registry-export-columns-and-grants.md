# Admin registry exports — owner decision 2026-10-11

D006. Owner reply to Q006: «Те же поля плюс Telegram ID для FULL admin; аудит факта».
Accepted user-export columns: ordinary registry fields ФИО, login, roles/statuses, group, staff number and Telegram binding state. Telegram ID is an additional column only for current FULL administrator authority. LIMITED export does not include Telegram ID. No initial/reset/user password or recovery link is exported; the accepted initial-password display exception remains separate.
Record the export fact in audit without file contents: actor, time, export kind and row count are safe fact metadata. Do not store credentials or exported personal-data contents in audit/artifacts.
Supersedes: unresolved exported-column/audit branch of canonical JS-ADMIN-13:253–259 and ПК132:202. Does not add an admin attendance-statistics screen or a new web frontend.

D007. Owner reply to Q007: «Разрешить соответствующую выгрузку по USERS_VIEW/GROUPS_VIEW (рекомендую)».
Current LIMITED USERS_VIEW permits the ordinary user-registry export; current LIMITED GROUPS_VIEW permits the ordinary group-registry export. Live grant and allowed scope/filter rules apply at initiation/read/download; revocation denies later operations. FULL admin remains permitted. No new permission code or credential grant is inferred. D006 restricts Telegram ID to FULL.
Supersedes: unresolved LIMITED ordinary bulk-export branch left by 2026-10-08-limited-administrators. Existing separate credentials grants/display rules remain unchanged.
Affected scope: server admin user/group exports in five accepted formats, server format catalogue, audit fact, FULL/LIMITED field and revocation tests, existing accepted mobile carrier where applicable.
